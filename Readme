##  What This Project Does

This project automates the following AWS infrastructure:

- **Remote Terraform backend** using **S3**
- **State file locking** using **DynamoDB**
- **EKS (Kubernetes) cluster** provisioning
- **EC2 instance** provisioning with NGINX
- **Reusable Terraform modules**
- Secure and scalable cloud infrastructure deployment

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

This project follows a **layered infrastructure design**:

1. **Remote Backend Layer**
   - S3 stores Terraform state files
   - DynamoDB provides state locking

2. **Network & Compute Layer**
   - VPC, subnets, and security groups
   - EC2 for application workloads
   - EKS for containerized applications

3. **Application Layer**
   - Terraform modules used to deploy reusable application infrastructure
